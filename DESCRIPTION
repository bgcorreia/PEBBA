Description: A critical step in differentially expressed gene (DEG) analysis is the 
    selection of a threshold for establishing DEG significance. However, many times this 
    important step is done arbitrarily. Therefore, the FAIRcc package is intended to 
    automatically analyze and determine the ideal threshold cutoff.
